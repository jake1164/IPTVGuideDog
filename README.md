# IPTVGuideDog 🐕

**Your open-source IPTV companion** — intelligently filters massive M3U playlists and EPG data down to just the channels you care about.

---

## 🎯 Why IPTVGuideDog?

IPTV providers often deliver **thousands of channels** across dozens of groups — sports, movies, international content, VOD libraries, and more. Most users only watch a fraction of these channels, but managing huge playlists is cumbersome:

- **Slow loading times** in media players
- **Difficult navigation** through irrelevant content  
- **Manual editing** is error-prone and tedious
- **No easy way to filter** live streams vs. VOD content
- **Credentials scattered** across URLs and scripts

**IPTVGuideDog solves these problems** with a powerful, flexible CLI that:

✅ **Filters playlists by channel groups** — keep what you want, drop the rest  
✅ **Supports live-only filtering** — isolate live streams from VOD/series  
✅ **Manages credentials securely** — `.env` files keep secrets out of git  
✅ **Preserves EPG data** — filtered guide matches your filtered channels  
✅ **Works cross-platform** — PowerShell, Bash, CMD, Docker  
✅ **Automatable** — perfect for cron jobs and scheduled updates

## 🚀 What the CLI Offers

### **Two Powerful Commands**

#### 1️⃣ `iptv groups` — Discover & Curate
Extract all channel groups from your playlist into a simple text file, then decide what to keep:

```bash
iptv groups --playlist-url "https://provider.com/playlist.m3u" --out-groups groups.txt --live
```

**Edit `groups.txt`** — comment lines with `#` to **KEEP**, leave uncommented to **DROP**:
```
#Sports           ← Keep
#News             ← Keep
Movies            ← Drop
International     ← Drop
##Documentary     ← Newly added (marked with ##)
```

**Features:**
- **Live-only mode** (`--live`) — only enumerate live streams, ignore VOD/series
- **Incremental updates** — new groups are automatically added and marked with `##`
- **Automatic backups** — never lose your curation work
- **Version tracking** — file format validation prevents conflicts

---

#### 2️⃣ `iptv run` — Fetch, Filter & Export
One-shot pipeline that downloads your playlist and EPG, applies group filters, and writes clean outputs:

```bash
iptv run \
  --playlist-url "https://provider.com/get.php?username=%USER%&password=%PASS%&type=m3u_plus" \
  --epg-url "https://provider.com/xmltv.php?username=%USER%&password=%PASS%" \
  --groups-file groups.txt \
  --out-playlist filtered.m3u \
  --out-epg filtered.xml \
  --live
```

**Features:**
- **Group filtering** — apply your curated `groups.txt` selections
- **Live-only mode** — filter out VOD/series, keep only live streams
- **Secure credential handling** — `.env` files auto-substitute `%USER%`/`%PASS%`
- **Atomic writes** — ensures output files are always valid (no partial writes)
- **Verbose logging** — track exactly what's being filtered and why
- **Config profiles** — store common setups in YAML for reuse

---

### **Credential Management Made Easy**

Stop embedding passwords in URLs or scripts! Use `.env` files:

**`.env` file:**
```env
USER=your_username
PASS=your_password
```

**Command:**
```bash
iptv run --playlist-url "https://host/get.php?username=%USER%&password=%PASS%&type=m3u_plus" --out-playlist out.m3u
```

- ✅ **Shell-safe** — `%USER%` works in PowerShell, Bash, CMD, Zsh  
- ✅ **Git-ignored** — credentials never leave your machine  
- ✅ **Zero-config mode** — just drop `.env` in your working directory

### **Config-Driven Workflows**

For advanced users, define reusable profiles in `config.yaml`:

```yaml
profiles:
  default:
    inputs:
      playlist:
        url: "${PROVIDER_PLAYLIST_URL}"
      epg:
        url: "${PROVIDER_EPG_URL}"
    output:
      playlistPath: "/data/out/playlist.m3u"
      epgPath: "/data/out/epg.xml"
```

Then run:
```bash
iptv run --config config.yaml --profile default --live
```

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### **Installation**

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/jake1164/IPTVGuideDog.git
cd IPTVGuideDog

# Build the CLI (requires .NET 8+)
dotnet build src/IPTVGuideDog.Cli

# Run the CLI
dotnet run --project src/IPTVGuideDog.Cli -- --help
```

Or create an alias for convenience:
```bash
# PowerShell
Set-Alias iptv "dotnet run --project src/IPTVGuideDog.Cli --"

# Bash/Zsh
alias iptv="dotnet run --project src/IPTVGuideDog.Cli --"
```

---

### **Quick Start: 3-Step Workflow**

#### **Step 1: Create a `.env` file** (optional, for credential security)
```env
USER=your_username
PASS=your_password
```

#### **Step 2: Generate a groups file**
```bash
iptv groups \
  --playlist-url "https://provider.com/get.php?username=%USER%&password=%PASS%&type=m3u_plus" \
  --out-groups groups.txt \
  --live
```

**Edit `groups.txt`** — add `#` before groups you want to keep.

#### **Step 3: Run the filter**
```bash
iptv run \
  --playlist-url "https://provider.com/get.php?username=%USER%&password=%PASS%&type=m3u_plus" \
  --epg-url "https://provider.com/xmltv.php?username=%USER%&password=%PASS%" \
  --groups-file groups.txt \
  --out-playlist filtered.m3u \
  --out-epg filtered.xml \
  --live
```

**Done!** Load `filtered.m3u` and `filtered.xml` into your favorite media player.

### **Automate with Cron (Linux/macOS)**

Keep your playlist fresh automatically:

```bash
# Update every 30 minutes
*/30 * * * * cd /path/to/IPTVGuideDog && iptv run --config config.yaml --profile default --live
```

- 🏠 **Per-room filtering** — different playlists for different family members  
- 🤖 **Scheduled updates** — automate with cron/Task Scheduler  

---

## 🗺️ Roadmap

- ✅ **CLI tool** (stable, production-ready)
- ✅ **Group-based filtering** with `.env` credential support
- ✅ **Live-only filtering** for separating live streams from VOD
- ✅ **EPG synchronization** with filtered playlists

### **Coming Soon**

  - Web-based group selection interface
  - Multi-profile management
  - Real-time playlist previews
  - Scheduled updates with built-in cron
  - Docker Compose deployment for easy self-hosting

### **Future Ideas**
- 🔮 **Advanced filtering** — regex-based title/description filters
