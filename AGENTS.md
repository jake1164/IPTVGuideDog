# Agent Rules For This Repository

## Documentation Policy

- Always use `mslearn` MCP tools for Microsoft/.NET/C# topics to get current official documentation before implementing or advising.
- Always use `context7` MCP tools for third-party libraries/frameworks in scope (for example: `sqlite`, `MudBlazor`, and other dependencies used by this repo) to confirm latest docs and best practices.
- Prefer guidance and implementations aligned with the latest stable documentation and recommended best practices.
- Match recommendations to the version actually installed/targeted/running in this project when version information is available.
- If a topic is not Microsoft-related, skip `mslearn` and use the relevant source (such as `context7` for supported libraries).
- If MCP access is unavailable, state that explicitly and use the best available official primary source as fallback.
